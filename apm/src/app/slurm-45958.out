parallel Pattern Matching code
Approximate Pattern Mathing: looking for 6 pattern(s) in file ../../dna/chr22.fa w/ distance of 2
GPU: 0 OMP: 1
We are assuming that one will never input patterns more than 20, otherwise it makes our app look redundant
OK, you don't have a GPU, but it seems that you don't have enough ranks, let's keep using static mpi
given that you don't have a GPU and have single openmp thread
our final decision is to implement pure MPI, over Static Decomposition
Our final decision is to use: decision 9
Number of matches for pattern <AABCCC>: 296393
Number of matches for pattern <ABBCCC>: 88065
Number of matches for pattern <AAASSCC>: 21032
Number of matches for pattern <AASFFF>: 2
Number of matches for pattern <FFSSADD>: 2
Number of matches for pattern <GASDSFA>: 2

OK, you don't have a GPU, but it seems that you don't have enough ranks, let's keep using static mpi
given that you don't have a GPU and have multiple openmp threads
our final decision is to implement MPI with each process running OMP, over Static Decomposition
