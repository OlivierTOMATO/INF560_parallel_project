GPU: 0 OMP: 1
We are assuming that one will never input patterns more than 20, otherwise it makes our app look redundant
OK, we plan to dynamically allocate your pattern to different process we have
given that you don't have a GPU and have single openmp thread
our final decision is to implement pure MPI over Dynamic Pattern Distribution
Our final decision is to use: decision 1

We are assuming that one will never input patterns more than 20, otherwise it makes our app look redundant
OK, we plan to dynamically allocate your pattern to different process we have
given that you don't have a GPU and have multiple openmp threads
our final decision is to implement MPI + OMP over Dynamic Pattern Distribution
