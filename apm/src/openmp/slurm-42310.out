MPI + OPENMP:
MPI: Each pattern is handled by different MPI ranks, this is useful when No. of Ranks (8) < (2) No. of Patterns
 OPENMP: The chunk received by each rank is run in parallel in all the available threads
Approximate Pattern Matching: looking for 2 pattern(s) in file ../../dna/chr22.fa w/ distance of 2
file size: 51834845
MPI Process: Each pattern is handled by different MPI ranks, this is useful when No. of Ranks (8) < (2) No. of Patterns
