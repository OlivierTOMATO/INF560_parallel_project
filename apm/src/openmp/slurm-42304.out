MPI: Each pattern is handled by different MPI ranks, this is useful when No. of Ranks (4) < (1) No. of Patterns
 OPENMP: The chunk received by each rank is run in parallel in all the available threads
Approximate Pattern Matching: looking for 1 pattern(s) in file ../../dna/chr7.fa w/ distance of 2
file size: 12445630
MPI Process: Each pattern is handled by different MPI ranks, this is useful when No. of Ranks (4) < (1) No. of Patterns
